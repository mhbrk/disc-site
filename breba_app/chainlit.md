## Breba — Prompts Are Code

Breba is a next-generation personalization and web creation platform where prompts become code.
Write instructions in plain English, and Breba’s intelligent agents turn them into fully deployed web pages — in just minutes.

Instead of writing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, you simply describe what you want, and Breba does the rest — powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) and real-time adaptive agents.

Breba helps you quickly build and publish websites without coding. It’s designed to make website creation easy, fast, and accessible to everyone — whether you’re showcasing your portfolio, writing a blog, or launching a project page.
